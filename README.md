# Power-BI-Dashboard-Project
Project Description:
The HR Data Analytics on Job Attrition Power BI Dashboard is a focused and strategic business intelligence solution designed to analyze and address the issue of job attrition within a company. This project involves the development of an interactive Power BI dashboard that empowers HR professionals and leadership to gain insights into the factors influencing employee attrition and to implement targeted retention strategies.

Key Objectives:

1.Data Collection and Integration: Gather relevant data from HRIS, payroll systems, employee surveys, performance records, and exit interviews. Integrate the data into a cohesive dataset while ensuring data quality and accuracy.

2.Dashboard Design: Create a user-friendly and visually appealing Power BI dashboard with a clear layout. Utilize appropriate visualizations, such as bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and tables, to represent attrition-related data.

3.Attrition Analysis: Provide an overview of overall attrition rates, including voluntary and involuntary separations. Segment attrition data by departments, job roles, tenure, age groups, and other relevant categories.

4.Attrition Drivers: Identify and visualize the key factors influencing attrition, such as compensation, career growth, work-life balance, job satisfaction, and management effectiveness. Use charts and heatmaps to show correlations between these factors and attrition rates.

5.Exit Interview Insights: Integrate insights from exit interviews, highlighting common reasons cited by departing employees. Use sentiment analysis to understand the sentiments expressed during exit interviews.

6.Tenure Analysis: Visualize attrition trends based on employee tenure. Identify if there are specific periods during which attrition rates tend to be higher, which could indicate potential issues.

7.Demographic Analysis: Analyze attrition rates across demographic groups, including age, gender, ethnicity, and education level. Identify if any specific group is disproportionately affected by attrition.

8.Retention Strategies: Present potential retention strategies and their potential impact based on data analysis. These strategies could include targeted training, career development programs, compensation adjustments, and more.

9.Comparative Analysis: Compare the company's attrition rates with industry benchmarks to assess the organization's attrition performance in context.

10.Predictive Modeling (Optional): Incorporate predictive models to forecast attrition rates based on historical data and identified factors. This can help HR teams proactively plan retention initiatives.

11.Interactive Features: Include interactive features like slicers and filters to allow users to explore attrition data based on various dimensions, such as time period, department, and job role.

12.Security and Compliance: Ensure that the dashboard complies with data privacy regulations and restricts access to authorized users.
